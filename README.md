### Disclaimer
For this project I used AJAX system. You normally want to use Web Sockets or WebRTC API.
If you want to scale this project to bigger audience I highly recommend using a real-time communication API.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install

```
You need Tomcat server 8 or above installed.
Locally installed MySQL or a MySQL server.
Compatible IDE, Intellij IDEA recommended for this project.
Web application 3.1 ( Configured web.xml is included )


```

### Installing



For MySQL Database 

```
You have to edit paintLogin.java Servlet to handle SQL communications if it is not compatible with your database.
Also you need to configure context data source and fill the necessary blanks.
If you want to use any database other than MySQL, you have to make necessary changes.
```

For Tomcat Application Server

```
Use Tomcat 8 or above. If you are running in online server like Amazon Elastic Beanstalk read the steps in paintLogin.java
and make changes to Data Source.
```

### Database 
This is a simple application so it has a simple database. SQL Script is below.

```
CREATE TABLE Users (
	UserID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Username varchar(40) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    UserPassword varchar(40) NOT NULL,
    UserEmail varchar(40) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(UserID),
    CONSTRAINT users_unique UNIQUE (Username)
);

```

Alternatively, with the correct naming conventions.

```
CREATE TABLE users (
	user_id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username varchar(40) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password varchar(40) NOT NULL,
    email varchar(40) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(user_id),
    CONSTRAINT users_unique UNIQUE (username)
);

```
